# Malaria Transmission Model
The **Malaria Transmission Model** is an open-source R-based framework designed to simulate and analyze malaria transmission dynamics. 

The objectives of this project are:  
- To implement compartmental and stochastic models of malaria transmission.  
- To explore the effects of interventions such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and antimalarial drugs.  
- To provide a reproducible and extensible platform for researchers and public health professionals.  
- To promote open collaboration and capacity building in infectious disease modeling.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- R basic
- RStudio (recommended)  
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Setup
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/malaria-transmission-model.git
cd malaria-transmission-model

install.packages(c("deSolve", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))


# Load required libraries
library(deSolve)
library(ggplot2)

# Source model functions
source("R/model_functions.R")

# Define parameters
params <- list(beta = 0.5, gamma = 0.1, mu = 0.01)

# Run simulation
results <- run_malaria_model(params, days = 365)

# Plot results
plot_malaria_dynamics(results)
